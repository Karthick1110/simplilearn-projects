1. Add an expense:

Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:
The date of the expense in the format YYYY-MM-DD
The category of the expense, such as Food or Travel
The amount spent
A brief description of the expense
Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs
Example: {'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description':'Lunch with friends'}
